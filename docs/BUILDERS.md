# Geometry Builders — the canonical registry

The heart of the system. A well-chosen set of builders lets most new
archetypes be assembled from YAML/Recipe without new Python code.

```text
archetype = "what we make"          (product semantics, contract, invariants)
builder   = "how we build it"       (geometry + regions + frame + validators)
modifier  = "how we adapt locally"  (region-bound fields/interfaces on top)
style     = "which skin"            (controlled form passes, engineering untouched)
```

## The builder contract (non-negotiable)

A builder that merely builds geometry is useless. Every builder must
deliver all four:

1. **Geometry** — a contribution to the PartForm (profile/plate/feature), never direct CAD calls.
2. **Semantic regions** — so modifiers know where they may act, and keepouts are derived automatically.
3. **Frame keys** — the single source of truth: probes measure exactly the numbers the geometry was built from.
4. **Validators** — the names of the form/topology checks it signs off on.
   A named feature without validator-backed geometry = a hallucination → missing/engine_gap.

A recipe op with no engine implementation = an honest engine-gap WARN and
unbuildable — the same mechanism as for validators and applicators. New
builders are born as a draft/coding-agent task, never as arbitrary Python
at runtime.

## The four kinds of builders

- **base** — create the primary body (one per part): profile sections,
  plates, revolve, sweep, loft.
- **feature** — attach to the body: holes, pockets, bosses, cutouts.
- **field** — region-bound arrays = MODIFIERS (already structured that way;
  do not move them into the recipe layer, composition via keepouts is already solved).
- **interface/joint** — fits, snaps, hinges, connections.

### field — modifiers (already region-bound, composition via keepouts)

Window mappings: planar, tilted (inclined faces), **cylindrical_z_mapping_v1**
(the side wall of revolve bodies: Z axis, full 360°, a single explicit seam_keepout;
cells are built in the tangent plane and cut radially; support-free is a
measured `manufacturing.max_opening_span`, not a promise).

| builder | status |
|---|---|
| `honeycomb_field` | ✅ add_hex_perforation (flat-to-flat 30°, min_ligament is measured) |

| `vein_rib_field` | ✅ | add_vein_ribs (standalone, seeded rhythm, additive) + biomorphic veins in style |
| `space_colonization_branching` | ⬜ R5 |

### style — not builders, a separate layer (settled)

`biomorphic_surface_deform` = SurfaceStyle biomorphic_utility_part (sliders →
controlled passes, preserve by construction). Do not mix with recipe.

### assembly joints (the assembly/joints.py registry — verified in pose)

| joint | status |
|---|---|
| `screw_joint` | ✅ R1: bolt circles coincide in pose, clear↔tap, axes void, interference |
| `lid_seat` | ✅ R2: the plug↔interior−2·clearance chain down to CAD + assembly.lid_seats in pose |
| `press_fit_pin_pair` | ✅ R2: PinFeature + interference contract (the pin is THICKER than the socket, overlap measured and bounded) |
| `split_plane_with_alignment` | ✅ in essence: butt_pin_joint (sections identical + end-face pins; PinFeature.axis) — raceway_400_split. An auto-generator from ONE instance = the next iteration's edit-intent |
| `snap_joint` | ✅ compliant: undercut + insertion strain 1.5·δ·t/L² ≤ 5% (esp32_box_snap_lid) |
| `dovetail_joint` | ✅ A1: undercut retention + clearance band + flank angle + full engagement; friction-only axial retention (declared) |

### interface / joint / mechanics

| builder | status / wave |
|---|---|
| `gusset_pair` | ✅ shelf_bracket_v1 (web gussets as ribs) |
| `snap_hook` / `snap_receiver` | ✅ | ops snap_hook_pair / snap_window_pair + snap_joint (the strain physics caught the first design: a 9mm beam was breaking) |
| `press_fit_pin_pair` | ✅ (see assembly joints) |
| `dovetail_joint` | ✅ A1: the cuff's socket crown + the adapters' male leg (forearm_cuff_body payload_mount=dovetail_socket / dovetail_adapter_body) |
| `split_plane_with_alignment` | ✅ (see assembly joints: butt_pin_joint) |
| `pin_hinge` | ⬜ R4 |
| `rail_slider` | ⬜ R5 |
| `living_hinge` | ⬜ R5 (material/fatigue — its own validators) |
| `thread_external` / `thread_internal_clearance` | ⬜ R5 |
| `bearing_seat` | ✅ recipe op (608/625/6001 table, the lip is probe-verified) |
| `shaft_coupler`, `ratchet_teeth`, `friction_hinge` | ⬜ |

## Implementation waves

- **R1 — Recipe kernel**: `form: {type: recipe}` in the archetype schema; a
  registry of recipe ops with fail-fast names at catalog load; promotion of
  already existing features into composable ops (`rounded_plate`, `hole_pattern`,
  `countersunk_hole_pattern`, `counterbore_hole_pattern`,
  `rounded_rect_cutout`); a demo archetype built ENTIRELY from YAML with no Python.
  Criterion: a new useful archetype (panel/grommet) is assembled as a recipe and
  passes the full honesty pipeline.
- **R2 — Enclosure core** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-07-03): shell/boss/port +
  lid_seat/standoff/nut_trap/heatset/wire_exit/counterbore; examples:
  esp32_box_base, esp32_box_with_lid (an assembly!), fastener_plate_demo,
  junction_box_60.
- **R3 — Maker profiles** ✅: snap_c_tongue (broom_clip_25mm) +
  open_c_channel (raceway_200). Remainder: cradles (generalization).
- **R4 — Strength & assembly** ✅ core: LoftFeature/tapered_beam +
  gusset webs (shelf_bracket_150). Remainder: sweep, joints/split_plane —
  waiting for the multi-part pipeline.
- **R5 — Wow & mechanics** ✅ core: bearing_seat + phyllotaxis_field
  (bearing_turntable_base). Remainder: threads, ratchet, branching,
  friction hinge.

## The honest remainder (deep mechanics — one iteration per item)

The wave leftovers are consolidated into a master plan: dovetail →
wave A1 (ports/interfaces), rail_slider and hinges/threads/ratchet →
later waves.

`dovetail`/`tongue_groove` and `rail_slider` are sliding fits (friction,
direction-of-travel tolerances); `pin_hinge` and `friction_hinge` are moving
assemblies (axis clearance, torque); `living_hinge` is material fatigue;
`thread_external/internal` is a helix sweep in OCC + a thread profile;
`shaft_coupler`, `ratchet_teeth` are torque transmission;
`space_colonization_branching` needs oriented additive geometry (diagonal
branches; Box3 ribs are not enough). Each of these has its own physics and
validators; a feature without them would be a hallucination, which is why they
are not "finished off" but planned as separate iterations on the completed
foundation (recipe + joints + pose probes).

## Print orientation — a cross-cutting concern

Every base builder must declare `print_orientation` (or honestly say
`as_modeled`), and the overhang validator must know about it. The lesson of
the sideprint clip: a constant extrusion with the profile on the bed = zero
overhangs by construction; this property is VERIFIED (`form.constant_section`),
not postulated.

## Interfaces (wave A1)

A connection = a DECLARED port: `interfaces:` on the archetype (id, type,
gender, datum, clearance, region, keepouts, accepts, assembly_role) drawn from
the registry of 11 types (`product/interfaces.py`). A joint implements a port
type; a mate is legal only with a matching type + complementary gender +
mutual accepts (`assembly/mates.py`); `forge compat` derives the catalog's
compatibility matrix; `assembly/swap.py` verifies a part swap
(interface.swap_part_builds). A builder that publishes a port must emit its
datum and the type's frame keys — `interface.frame_exists` measures this.
